{"name":"jutils","tagline":"Simple utilities for powerful programming","body":"# jutils\r\nSimple and handful utilities missing from the main Java package.\r\n\r\nThe information below includes changelogs and information about the tools under this package.\r\nOld tools are not well documented and not documented at all because this was only my personal\r\nbunch of tools since then.\r\n\r\nMaven Changelog:\r\n> v1.0  Initial release, and now in the cloud!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nSMSModule - simple utility for sending and reading SMS from a GSM modem.\r\n\r\n> Installation SMSLib:\r\n\r\n> Before using this SMS Utility, necessary libraries and drivers must be downloaded first at\r\n> [SMSLib installation](http://smslib.org/doc/installation/) and must be placed into appropriate location.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n> RxTX installation is a bit confusing since it was platform-dependent.\r\n> NOTE: You MUST match your architecture. You can't install the i386 version on a 64-bit version of the JDK and vice-versa.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n> For Windows 32-bit and 64-bit:\r\n\r\n>    For a JDK installation:\r\n\r\n> * Copy RXTXcomm.jar ---> `<JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\lib\\ext`\r\n> * Copy rxtxSerial.dll ---> `<JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\bin`\r\n> * Copy rxtxParallel.dll ---> `<JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\bin`\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n> For Linux 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n\r\n>    For a JDK installation on architecture=i386\r\n\r\n> * Copy RXTXcomm.jar ---> `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext`\r\n> * Copy librxtxSerial.so ---> `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/`\r\n> * Copy librxtxParallel.so ---> `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/`\r\n\r\n> NOTE: For a JDK installation on architecture=x86_64, just change the i386 to x86_64 above.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n> For Mac OSX\r\n\r\n>    Copy RXTXcomm.jar and librxtxSereial.jnilib to,\r\n> * `/Library/Java/Extensions` - to make available to all users \r\n> * `~/Library/Java/Extensions` - to make available to only your user so it is your choice.\r\n\r\n> ADDITIONAL INFO:\r\n\r\n> RXTXcomm needs to have /var/lock folder in able to save a lock file. This should be done after the steps above.\r\n\r\n> - Make a directory “/var/lock”\r\n> - Set new ownership and permission of /var/lock\r\n>    `sudo chgrp uucp /var/lock`\r\n>    `sudo chmod 775 /var/lock`\r\n> - Set all owners of /var/lock to “Read & Write”\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nJavaMail Framework - simple utility for sending Email message.\r\n\r\n> This utility supports HTML or Text only format in mail message.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nXPersist - utility for handling Eclipselink's `EntityManagerFactory`. \r\n\r\n> This utility reads/updates `persistence.xml` along runtime, and may alter the host for the specified server.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nSerial/JSSC - utility for communicating with Serial ports.\r\n\r\n> This utility uses Java's native gnu.io package and a third-party library JSSC. \r\n> I made two different Serial library because I've encountered problem with JSSC on other devices. But performance wise, JSSC is better.\r\n\t\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
