You can't install the i386 version on a 64-bit version of the JDK and vice-versa.\r\n\t\r\n> For Windows 32-bit and 64-bit:\r\n\tFor a JDK installation:\r\n\t\tCopy RXTXcomm.jar ---> <JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\lib\\ext\r\n\t\tCopy rxtxSerial.dll ---> <JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\bin\r\n\t\tCopy rxtxParallel.dll ---> <JAVA_HOME>\\jre\\bin\r\n\t\t\t\r\n> For Linux 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n\tFor a JDK installation on architecture=i386\r\n\tCopy RXTXcomm.jar ---> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext\r\n\tCopy librxtxSerial.so ---> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/\r\n\tCopy librxtxParallel.so ---> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/\r\n\tNOTE: For a JDK installation on architecture=x86_64, just change the i386 to x86_64 above.\r\n\t\t\r\n> For Mac OSX\r\n\tCopy RXTXcomm.jar and librxtxSereial.jnilib to,\r\n\t/Library/Java/Extensions - to make available to all users \r\n\t~/Library/Java/Extensions - to make available to only your user\tso it is your choice.\r\n> ADDITIONAL INFO:\r\n\tRXTXcomm needs to have /var/lock folder in able to save a lock file. This should be done after the steps above.\r\n\t1. Make a directory “/var/lock”\r\n\t2. Set new ownership and permission of /var/lock\r\n        > ## sudo chgrp uucp /var/lock\r\n        > ## sudo chmod 775 /var/lock\r\n\t3. Set all owners of /var/lock to “Read & Write”\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n#----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJavaMail Framework - simple utility for sending Email message.\r\n\r\n#----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nXPersist - utility for handling Eclipselink's EntityManagerFactory. \r\n\r\n> This utility uses the project's persistence.xml along runtime, and alter's its URL by the specified server.\r\n\r\n#----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSerial/JSSC - utility for communicating with Serial ports.\r\n\r\n> This utility uses java's native gnu.io package and a third party library JSSC. \r\n> I made two different Serial library because I've encountered problem with JSSC on other devices. But performance wise, JSSC is better.\r\n\t\r\n#----------------------------------------------------------\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
